DESCRIPTION

The aim of this program is to clusterize data by defining the optimal centroids. The algorith is named k-Means cluster. The program take the data from a file and select x (entered by the user) random datapoint, that are the starting point of the centroids.  The data can be of any dimensions as long as they are identical. Afterwards, the program iterates until obtaining an optimal solution for the centroids, which minimize the euclidean distance of the data to the centroids. As the first values are taken randomly, the final results can diverge.

It is used in the scientific community to realise unsupervised learning, which is a branch of artificial intelligence. It allows to clusterize data. In other terms, it divides a data set into several groups which have similar features. In other domain, this method can be used to generalized a large data set.

What is missing in the program is a function that allows to analysed new datapoints in order to define their classes.

By running the program, we can obtain different results, due the random selection of the first centroids. After several tests, we conclude that the best answer for the number of centroids is two, that find the optimal solution within 2 to 6 iterations. However, three centroids can also be a valid solution, as the number of iterations is around 3 to 8. This results can be easily explained by looking at a graphic of the data (in the folder). In fact, we can see two groups of data well separated, however the second group is more spread and this is why three centroids can also be an answer.
